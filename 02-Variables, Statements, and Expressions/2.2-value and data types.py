# Source code -->  Interpreter --> Output

# Source Code: The instruction of a program save in a file, in a high-level language before being
# compiled or interpreted.

# Interpreter: A translator that translate Source code from high-level lang to low-level lang
# at a time one line.o


# input: a file , text, or intruction , program
# output: a file,


# When writing code we actually writing called expressions.

'''
Expressions -->  value --> type
every expression has a value , and a value has a type
'''

100    # This is an Expressions -> value 100 --> type integer
3.14   # This is an Expressions -> value 3.14 --> type fload

''' 
We want to do something and then give us back some value in the output window.
in other words, we don't just want our source code to go the python interpreter and 
get no output.

we usually actually want some output or some feedback from our programs.
what we need to do is we use what are called print statements.

Print statement:
-------------------
it is a special kind of statement that do something to show up on screen.
'''

print(100)
print("value and data types tutuorial 02")
print(3.14)


'''
Data types
--------------
The expressions that we've written so far are what are called literal expressions.
Where the values is the same as the expression itself.
e.g the above expressions. 100 , 3.14 .
Integers
Floats
Strings
