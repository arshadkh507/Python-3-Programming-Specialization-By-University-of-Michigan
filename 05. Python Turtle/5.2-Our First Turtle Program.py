'''Modify this program so that before it creates the window, it prompts the user to enter the desired background color.It should store the user’s responses in a variable, and modify the color of the window according to the user’s wishes. (Hint: you can find a list of permitted color names at https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp. It includes some quite unusual ones, like “PeachPuff” and “HotPink”.)

Do similar changes to allow the user, at runtime, to set tess’ color.

Do the same for the width of tess’ pen. Hint: your dialog with the user will return a string, but tess’ pensize method expects its argument to be an int. That means you need to convert the string to an int before you pass it to pensize.'''
