# Variables are use to store the values or expressions values to use later in the program.
# The varibles allow us to give human readable name to value to use later on
#  for example pi in maths we use just the symbol of pi instead of 3.1459 etc to easy to human calculation
#  and easy to readable. pi is almost like a variable it has name and value.


message = "what's up, Doc?"
n = 17
pi = 3.14

print(message)
print(n)
print(pi)

# It's useful to be able to kind of simulate the execution of program like in your mind in order to do that , we have called
# a variable values diagram or refrence diagram.

# to draw a refrence we go line by line from top to bottom.
# every line we are going to say what variable is set to what value.
# refrence diagram have two columns varibale and values.

# Every varable has a name and value.
# Value can be anythig
# name has some restrictions
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# 2. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# 3. A variable name cannot start with a number
# 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
